# redux-saga-kit

redux-saga is a very sophisticated and awesome library, but it's not that easy to work with.

This package aims to help with the creation and development of sagas.

## Prerequisites:
* [redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga/)

## What This Project Includes
At the moment, this project includes only two methods:
* The **sagaCreator** - used for creating sagas
 * **stateSelector** - A helper method to easily create saga selectors

**MORE TO COME - WORK IN PROGRESS**
